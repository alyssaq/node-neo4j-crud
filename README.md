# Neo4j node sample
A sample usage of storing and querying data from the graph database [neo4j](www.neo4j.org/) using node

## Usage
1. Install neo4j locally. If you use Mac, I recommend using homebrew: `brew install neo4j`
1. Install dependencies `npm install`

## Run
1. `npm start`, which is a shortcut of `node app/index.js`
